### Hi there 👋

👩‍💻 About Me :

I'm a Front-End Developer based in Tajikistan

🌱 I'm currently exploring JavaScript

⚡ More facts: As a front-end developer, I'm always willing to take risks and dive deep into new challenges, both in the code and in life. In fact, I've jumped out of a plane while skydiving and dived 20 meters deep into the water - which just goes to show that I'm not afraid to step outside of my comfort zone, even if it means facing my fears head-on. But that's not the only leap of faith I've taken in my life - I used to work for a Swiss Representation for about 5 years and pursued my Masters in Project Management, but I decided to take the plunge and pursue my passion for front-end development. Now, I'm fluent in both English, Russian and German, which allows me to connect with people from all walks of life and collaborate on new projects. When it comes to problem-solving, I'm always ready to roll up my sleeves and dive into the code, finding creative solutions and breaking down barriers like a fearless explorer in a new frontier. But at the end of the day, I'm not just a developer - I'm a lifelong learner, constantly striving to stay up-to-date on the latest trends and techniques in my field, like a curious astronaut floating through the cosmos. And hey, if I can dive 20 meters deep into the ocean, learning a new coding language is a piece of cake, right?
